# LLM-driven Data Engineering

## Getting Started

Make an OpenAI account [here](https://platform.openai.com/) and then generate an API Key.

- You will need to supply a credit card but you will also get $5 in free credit which is more than enough for this lab and tomorrow's lab.


Store the API key as an environment variable like:

`export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`

Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the OpenAI and Pandas libraries

## Lab

We'll be using the schemas from Week 1 and generating the queries from the homework and labs except this time we'll do it via LLMs
